## ✨ Features

* **100% Free:** No paid APIs, services, or subscriptions are required.
* **HuggingFace Integration:** Utilizes a custom server setup on HuggingFace to combine Speech-to-Text (STT), a Large Language Model (LLM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
* **Hardware:** Built around the powerful **ESP32-S3** development board.
* **Current Language:** Currently supports **English only**. (Multi-language support is a future goal).

## ⚙️ Hardware Requirements

The use of **PSRAM** is critical for voice recording and processing tasks, so make sure your board has it!

| Component | Details | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development Board** | **ESP32-S3** (16MB Flash, **8MB PSRAM**) | ⚠️ **PSRAM is mandatory** for the code to function correctly. |
| **Display** | ST7789 TFT Display | Check the separate display tutorial link in the video description for configuration. |
| **Microphone** | INMP441 I2S MEMS Microphone | **Crucial:** Add a capacitor between Ground and VCC on the microphone. |
| **Audio Amp** | MAX98357A I2S Audio Amplifier | Connected to a half-watt, 8-ohm speaker. |
| **Trigger** | Tactile Button | Used to start and stop the voice recording. |
| **Wiring** | Separate I2S Lines | Dedicated I2S GPIO pins are used for the microphone and the amplifier to simplify control and avoid noise. |

## ☁️ Server Setup (HuggingFace Space)

The AI magic happens on a free HuggingFace Space.

1.  **Create a HuggingFace Account** and go to **"New Space"**.
2.  **Space Configuration:**
    * **Space SDK:** Choose `Docker`.
    * **Template:** Select `Blank`.
    * **Space Hardware:** Use `CPU Basic`.
3.  **Upload Server Files:** Copy the following files from this repository and create them in your new HuggingFace Space (`Files` tab -> `Contribute` -> `Create new file`):
    * `Dockerfile`
    * `app.py`
    * `docker-compose.yml`
    * `requirements.txt`
4.  **Create an Access Token:** Go to your profile's `Access Tokens`, create a **"Write"** token, and copy it.
5.  **Set a Secret:** In your Space's **Settings** tab, scroll down to **Secrets** and create a new secret:
    * **Name (Must be exact):** `HF_TOKEN`
    * **Value:** Paste your copied token here.
6.  Wait for the server state to go from **"Building"** to **"Running"**. Check the **Logs** if any error occurs.

## 💻 Arduino Firmware Setup

1.  **Install Libraries:** Download and install all required libraries (links in the video description). Note: The ESP8266 audio library works fine with ESP32.
2.  **Code Configuration:**
    * Enter your **WiFi SSID and Password**.
    * Update the **Server URL** with your specific HuggingFace Space URL (Pay attention to case sensitivity).
3.  **ESP32 Board Settings:**
    * Ensure **PSRAM is enabled** in the Tools menu.
    * Select a **Partition Scheme** that includes **SPIFFS**.
4.  **Upload** the code to your ESP32-S3 board.

## ▶️ How to Use

* Once the display shows **"Assistant Ready"**, the system is operational.
* **Press and hold** the tactile button to start recording your voice into PSRAM.
* **Release** the button to stop recording and automatically send the audio to the server.
* The AI server processes the request (STT -> LLM -> TTS), and sends the response audio back to the ESP32.
* The ESP32 downloads the audio to the LittleFS and **automatically plays** the answer on the speaker.

Enjoy building your AI Assistant! See you in the next episode!
